# this-is-jeopardy
This is a Codecademy challenge project to analyze data from the show Jeopardy. This project requires:
- Data cleaning
- Creating and maintaining DataFrames
- Computing aggregate statistics
- Python functions

Description from Codecademy:
This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project youâ€™ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.
